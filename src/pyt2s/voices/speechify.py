class Tone(__enum__):
    Story_Telling = "A calm, enchanting voice with a touch of mystique — smooth and measured, with subtle rises that draw the listener deeper into the world of Vyrneth. The tone should feel ancient yet ageless, like someone who's seen centuries unfold but still speaks with warmth and curiosity."
    Training = "A clear, upbeat voice with a friendly tone and a touch of enthusiasm. Mid-range pitch — not too deep or too high — conveying confidence and trust. Smooth pacing, with subtle emphasis on key phrases like “professional voiceover,” “Speechify Studio,” and “studio-quality audio.” The delivery should feel natural, like a helpful guide rather than a salesperson."
    Sports_Commentator = "Energetic, fast-paced, crisp American accent; rising intonation, dramatic pauses, thrilling delivery."
    Professional_Intro = "A warm, confident, and approachable baritone with a touch of enthusiasm.  A tone similar to a friendly, tech-savvy professional—clear enunciation, a slight smile in the delivery. A subtle hint of charisma, like Chris Hemsworth narrating a commercial"
